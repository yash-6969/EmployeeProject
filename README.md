### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name
2. Backend Setup (Node.js)
Navigate to the backend folder (assuming you have one):

Bash

cd backend
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your database connection details.

Code snippet

DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_CONNECT_STRING=localhost/your_db_service_name
PORT=5000
Start the backend server:

Bash

npm run dev 
The server should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

3. Frontend Setup (React)
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

Bash

cd ../frontend 
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Start the frontend development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The application will automatically open and be accessible at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is busy).

üîå API Endpoints
The backend server provides the following RESTful API endpoints:
